# ðŸŽ² React Dice Game

This is a simple React-based Dice Game.

You first select a number, then roll the dice.  
If the dice shows the same number as your selection, you earn points.  
If the numbers are different, your score decreases by the difference (for example, if you selected 3 and rolled a 5, your score becomes -2).

The game also includes:
- **Reset Score** button  
- **Show / Hide Rules** button to view or hide the game instructions.
